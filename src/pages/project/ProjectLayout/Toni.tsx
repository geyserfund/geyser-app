I have been passionate about Bitcoin since 2013, and Iâ€™ve always focused on building products on top of it. I started with using proof of existence (timestamping), then with tokenization on the Colored Coins protocol. More recently my team and I created [Watafan.com](http://watafan.com/) (2018), the first NFT platform built on a Bitcoin sidechain (RSK). And with the development of the Lightning Network so many new possibilities opened up for gaming, so we built Day of Genesis. Day of Genesis brings fun and learning together, by leveraging the power of Lightning. By building it, we hope that with fun and play, we can spread Bitcoin to the world. Join us!',
