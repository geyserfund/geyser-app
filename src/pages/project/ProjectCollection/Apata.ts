			'I plan on going street to street enlightening youths about bitcoin and lightning.',
			' I noticed that the key to massive adoption of bitcoin and lightning in Nigeria is by talking to youths in the street who are ready to listen and sharing Satoshis with them if they are new to Bitcoin. I will also share satoshis to bitcoiners who answer some certain questions. I also plan on teaching them easy ways to stack satoshis like thundr games e.t.c.. i believe Nigeria can transform from an underdeveloped country to a super developed country with the help of bitcoin and lightning. I would love all bitcoiners around the world who buy this idea and vision to help support massively and make it a reality. I plan on sharing 80% of the SATs donated to the street and the remaining 20% for transportation and feeding. ',
