		'Nigeria is a country with double digit inflation, and yet youths are not aware of the pitfalls and dangers that this poses to their economic welfare. All in all, Nigerian youths don‚Äôt know how to create and maintain wealth, and poverty is raging in the country.  A solution is then needed to improve youths‚Äô awareness on how to maintain and grow their wealth, through a conversation of money and Bitcoin.',
		'Bitcoin and the Lightning network are the key. They can teach the youths on how to earn and transfer without fees, and save without the value of their assets being debased, thanks to Bitcoin. Inspired by what is happening in El Salvador, my belief is that Nigeria can be among one of the first adopters of Bitcoin as money and a currency of enlightenment in the world.',
		'To do that we need to spread the word of Bitcoin to those who have most to gain from it, and the most to lose should they not learn about it. The youths of Nigeria represent the future of this country, only with them can we move our country outside of the cycle of poverty that exists.',
