## Create Query in GraphQL folder
- Add the necessary query, mutation, fragment or subscription in the right folder inside the graphql folder
- Look into [graphql.ts](mdc:src/types/generated/graphql.ts) to find the right Query, Mutation or Object to construct the query, mutation, subscription

## Use Hooks
- If you need to call a Query or Mutation, always check the [graphql.ts](mdc:src/types/generated/graphql.ts) file to find the auto-generated hook
- Do not call useQuery or useMutation directly.
