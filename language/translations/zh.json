And yet, most people still see it as a tool for gambling, money for criminals, a ponzi scheme, or an ecological nightmare. This is why the work of Bitcoin educators is so important. Much work is still needed to empower people around the world to use Bitcoin as a tool for escaping rampant inflation, financial censorship and banklessness. For more information, see here.": "这笔拨款的目的是支持非盈利的比特币教育。比特币是一个保护人权和自由的重要工具。它正在通过提供金融自由和可访问性革命化世界金融系统。可惜，许多人仍然把它看为赌博、黑钱、庞氏骗局或生态灾难。因此比特币教育工作至关重要。要让世界各地的人们能够使用比特币逃避通货膨胀、金融审查和无金融访问权还需要很多工作。在此了解更多。",
