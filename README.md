### Enabling the Open Creator Economy
Traditional Crowdfunding and Creator Platforms are built on closed monetary and social networks, which limits the use of crowdfunding (a powerful financial primitive) to around 30 Western countries and restricts project reach and social interaction to the platform. 

Geyser is enabling the Open Creator Economy, by building fundraising on top of open Bitcoin/Lightning, open monetary networks, and Nostr, an open social network. With these tools we can empower creators globally to reach their communities and raise funds from them.

As an open company, we also build Open Source software and rely on the support of contributors to change the world for the better.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

<br />

### Prerequisites

**Yarn**
We use yarn as a dependency manager, install yarn if not already installed
- `npm install --global yarn`

**Docker** ( optional )
We can use `docker` and `docker compose` for local development of the `geyser-app`.
If you prefer using docker for development, make sure to have them installed on your local development machine, see [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

<br />

### Installing Dependencies

Clone the repo, get into the repo directory and run:
```shell
yarn
```

<br />

### Environment Variables

The app requires some environment variables to be set. We provide an `example.env` file that you can copy to the a local `.env` file:

```shell
cp .env.example .env
```

From there, populate the new file with the correct values. You have two development environment options, detailed below.


<br />

### Running the App Locally

<br />

#### Option 1: use the staging API with Docker

Make sure to complete the instructions described in [Hosts Configuration](#hosts-configuration), before proceeding using this method.

Currently, the staging API is the only way to get a functional authentication flow in standalone `geyser-app` development environment.

To use the staging API, fill in the following value in the `.env` file:

```shell
VITE_APP_API_ENDPOINT=https://api.staging.geyser.fund
```

Start the server:
```shell
make dev
```

<br />

#### Option 2: use the staging API on host machine

Many at times we prefer using host machine intead of docker to run the server. In such cases we can use them directly.

Install dependencies:
```shell
yarn install
```

Start the server:
```shell
yarn dev
```

<br />

#### Docker

If you run into problems running the app through make command, you can run the app by running the following command in the project directory, as long as one of the docker configuration above is satisfied.

```shell
docker compose up -d
```

Or, if you are running an older version of docker and have docker-compose installed separately, run:

```shell
docker-compose up -d
```

To see the react app logs use the following command:

```shell
docker compose logs -f geyser-app
```

or

```shell
docker-compose logs -f geyser-app
```

<br />

### Hosts Configuration

<br />

#### Staging API

In order for the requests to go through to the staging backend API, you will need to add the following line to your `/etc/hosts` file:

```shell
127.0.0.1 staging.geyser.fund
```

This makes sure that you are able to make requests to the staging API from your local development environment with encountering CORS errors.

<br />

#### GraphQL Faker

If running against the GraphQL Faker server, you'll also need these in the same `/etc/hosts` file:

```shell
127.0.0.1 dev.geyser.fund
127.0.0.1 api.dev.geyser.fund
```

<br />

### Trusting Caddy Local CA Certificate

We are using Caddy as a reverse proxy to serve the local development app over HTTPS. This means that you will need to trust the Caddy Local CA Certificate in order to avoid any `ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID` errors in your browser.

To do so, you can run the following command from the project root directory **after starting the app and caddy server**:

```shell
sudo yarn caddy:trust-ca
```

This command will add the Caddy Local CA Certificate to your system's list of trusted certificates (only works on MacOS for now). It needs sudo rights for that.

<br />

### Opening in the Browser

With Docker running, navigate to the staging URL provided below.

<br />

#### Staging

<https://staging.geyser.fund/>

<br />

### Testing

We have end-to-end tests with Cypress. To run the tests locally, we'd need to create a `cypress.env.json` file in the root directory, with the following key values:
```shell
APP_URL,
CONTRIBUTOR_LND_ENDPOINT,
CONTRIBUTOR_LND_ADMIN_MACAROON_HEX,
MINE_BLOCK_ADDRESS,
BITCOIND_ENDPOINT,
BITCOIND_AUTH
```

then
```shell
make test
```
